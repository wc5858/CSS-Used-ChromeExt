## FAQ

1. Permission to read my browsing history

    See https://github.com/painty/CSS-Used-ChromeExt/wiki/Permission-to-read-my-browsing-history%3F

1. Local preview not right

    As for the CSS rule like `.wrap p{...}`, if only `<p>` is selected, the result `.wrap p{...}` may not apply directly to `<p>`.
    Either changing this rule's selector to `p{...}` or giving the `<p>` a `.wrap` parent in the final HTML.

1. Not all the CSS is got

    The result is generated based on the CURRENT HTML DOM. If a div doesn't exist in the document unless a specific user interaction, the result may miss out the style rules for the newly born div.
    
1. Always says to fresh the page

   First check whether it's Chrome Web Store pages, which is `https://chrome.google.com/webstore/....`, which won't allow content script injection. If it's a normal webpage , please create an issue.
